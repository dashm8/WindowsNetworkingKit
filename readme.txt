ok who else uses linux and windows and hates windows you too great so this is a tool for some of the defult networking feature that would
come with a defult linux distribution fill free to add new tools 

usage run networkingkit.py 

then for exemple use nc to connect to a server like that 
>nc 10.0.0.1 4444

this command will connect you to 10.0.0.1 server at 4444 port
